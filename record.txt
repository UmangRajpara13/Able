We should be together too Damn it sir, I'm too good to call and write my fans This will be the last pack, it's our ever-senior ass Been six months, it's still no word, I don't deserve it I know you got my last two letters, I wrote these dresses on a market So this is my cassette, I'm singin' you, I'm hilarious I'm in a car right now, I'm doin' 90 on a freeway Hey slim, I feel fit to put you in the drive You know this song, my bill call is the airman tonight You're about that guy who's gonna say that All the guys who drowned in was the end, then they'll saw it all Then had it so he found him, that's kinda how this is You could arrest you, me from drowning, now it's too late I'm on a thousand, now I'm drowsy, and all I wanted was a lousy letter of a call I hope you know I ripped all your pictures off the wall I love you slim, we gonna bring together, think about it You're ruined now, I hope you can't sleep and you dream about it And when you dream, I hope you can't sleep and you scream about it I hope you're conscious, eat into it, and you can't breathe without me See slim, in front of the song Hey slim, that's my girlfriend But I didn't, I just, I just, see I ain't like you Cause if you suffer more, need some soup Well, gotta go, I'm almost at the bridge now I forgot, I must go to see this, go!

You try to understand that I'd want you as a fan I just don't want you to do some crazy I've seen the one that's on the news a couple weeks ago That made me sick, no one's drunk and so is calling for a friend And then the party found a date, but they didn't say it was two Come to think about it, this name was... it was you Damn

But he keeps on forgetting what he wrote down, the whole crowd goes so loud, he opens his mouth, but the words won't come out, he's choking out. Everybody's choking now, the clock's run out, times up, over a cloud, smit back to reality. Up, there goes gravity, up, there goes gravity, choke, he's so mad, but he won't give up that easy note. He won't have any notes, his own backs and his ruffs, he's so mad.

There are the first few words, the new, better batch, the longest text in the entire history known in the universe. This has to have over 35,000 words. The current world market is so fucking annoying that I am going to imagine you are going to a friend's also you text is same normal, right? But it's what is easy to add up to the video.

We can kind of subtract, but I needed that. We needed that. Yeah. What did you apply for? Uh, what all of us should do that, um, we actually saw this. Which, what we needed to say about this, is that we have a new house. We will, uh, do you want more energy and become this house? Right. We need to get to the house. Of course. We need to be perfect about it, but we need to see what we got. We need to start with a single second. We need to be able to say, you know, I don't know, you know, that you're a good one. You know, you know, that you can't, that you can't, that you can't, that you can't, that you can't use. You can't use this. The house is specified a room to kind of see, when you say the room, the house is kind of, like, trying to be initiated. And then you can't wait. So you've got the house to be nice. And so, one is to just put on a little bit of your house. Okay, to get, I'll try to say, you can't say, you must be able to have a glass of glass to go right around. And so much value is that you have to be able to know this. If you make a look for the house that you are, the house isn't over planetized, but if you guys, I hope that you live to be behind, that you can't even live through the house. So you can live through nothing viewed. Because what you want to see is that you're feeling yourself from living. It's not as far as your life course is to live?! I don't know, where whatever appears, don't maybe you live within life that anyone's life. You know, I'm still there, too. I'm just listening to the old. I'm just going to go through it. I mean, you need to show that for people. Kind of, yes. Perhaps you want to hear a kick of sound. I mean, the phone is in the door. I mean, the phone is in the door.

Punjabi, are you sick? Sick, not so sick. Fuck the sakes, man. Those who do some weird and terrible shit, and they got that bracelet, that little sword bracelet. That's a bad ass bracelet. Not for real. It's back in the day that used to be a she. It would protect them from swords, because the six were the warrior class of people in India. And then over the years, you know, the meaning has changed now, is used to rest in a stairwell or whatever. And then over the years, you know, the meaning has changed now, is used to rest in a stairwell or whatever. But they got that bracelet walking that stairwell. They had never crashed, they were never crashed. You got this new take the wheel, huh? Did I get that right at least? I got that. You got that one perfect. Were your parents okay with you dating a black guy?

Brown parents don't give a fuck about the daughter, bro. I'm gonna go. I'm gonna go. I'm gonna go. I'm gonna go. I'm gonna go. I'm gonna go. Must be a doctor. I'm gonna go. You got that one, perfect.

Can I have a start with the region? I understand. I'm gonna go with the region. Okay. I'm gonna say... At least... Okay. Are you in the Middle East now? I'm in the Middle East now as well. Okay, a little too confident. I'm in the middle. Alright. Once that Ian Mubarak comes around, who knows what's going on. He's not really excited about that shit.

Our biggest export is from us Even though you're wrong that was a good fucking gas dude you to be aware of like Middle Eastern finances Sure gonna watch out well ballast that is the buffer Let's see what's going on over there Doc t.s. Is First of all, that's what I'm talking about. Because you've got no place in it, it's like home. I'm gonna talk about that. Wouldn't you really like handles this? You do? What's one to do? I'll see where you're safe.
Every animal, they're sweet. Every single animal, they all have life. You're right. I'm gonna say wait about that.
I feel like you haven't experienced enough life or death situations with animals.
and they can handle cares about your life.
I think a polar bear is going, you know what? She's probably got back in on Tuesday. Maybe I won't eat her. I'm just going to sit here with this Coca-Cola and sip it with my nephews. What I understand, you like animals because, you know, you live in the first world and it's boring. I don't care about you. I get it. I'll just take a look at this. Second. I'll paint almost thought you said, do you see me? I'm an animal. Then ask me. I was about to be like, oh, look at that. Second. I was about to be like, whoa. Because you're Asian, right? So that would make you panda a little bit, right? No. You're third world. You're third world. You're third world. You're third world. I'm third world. I'm third world. I'm third world. I'm third world. I'm third world. You're third world, but you're from America, right? You're born to race here. You're born to be born to Philippines. When did you come here? Oh, so you had some real shit. And in the Philippines, are there any animals that they eat that we don't eat here? You're not going to win this. You're not going to win this. It's not about what I lose. It's not about what I lose. I understand they said, in the Philippines, they eat dogs, because they don't care as much about dogs, right? Because they don't have to go like that. No, that's a call that they got to Wawa. Because they get too hungry. I don't know. Come, come, come, come, come, come, come. Right in there, right in there, right in there. There we go. I said war. I said war. With rice, almost a price off. That's all I'm saying. We're very lucky that we get to care about these. What part of Philippines we're from? Simple. Now is that a wealthy region or is that a poor region?
It's probably poor, right? I'm just guessing. It's... right? We don't got to go into it. It's a poor region where there's probably things there, right? That they'd be so lucky and grateful to have. That we just take for granted, right? You know what I'm saying? I'm drinking water right there. It might not be the best. Maybe there's some people that don't even have fresh drinking. You know? And tonight, you're going to go home and take a shit into clean water. That's why I hate this song. I care about my people back up. I just... We have to look at how people prefer when we're all coming. Watch.
Hey! Because I live in a Manhattan apartment that's heated by a radiator. So every morning I wake up like this. There's a building on fire!
Guys get out of right here There. Okay.
I'm taking this to the blanket and that's what the fuck it is. This is what we're doing. The place formed by a war was sounding like someone's beating it with a hockey stick. We'll go ask those questions. I guess that won't be good. We're going to go to the bathroom. This is our business. You can't let this hole in the hole directly to the smoke above my face. It's not a problem. We're the only city in the whole world where they don't tell us if you see something, say something. In every other city that's calling knowledge, go and see something that's running over. Take one tell people in your video that's his business. Oh, my gosh! That's a business. That's a business. That's a business. I asked one super in my whole life. One super. I asked him. I said Jose. One of those who fucking said I don't even know if that was his name. I just called him that shit. I can't write out the gate call to Jose. It's going to be your name, Jose, because I don't know what to tell you. I said Jose, you question why is the radio to make that clanking sound? Jose said to me, always because of the water. I actually waited like he was going to finish that door. I thought he was going to offer more clarity. He just stared at me like I was the idiot. What do you mean about the water? Oh, my God. Oh, okay. Okay, okay, okay, pop it. It's water come to reply. It's heated reply, it's heated reply, it's heated reply, it's heated reply. That's why I'm making the clanking sound. Okay, it's not the key. It's heated, it is to the left. He's heated to the apartment to the right, it's heated and it's all there. It's all making a lot of cred. There are so many kids, there are so many people. Do you know science? No! No! Aladdin taps. Please, it's a passion. Passver doesn't have to be a computer. Pass goes out of the heat. When do Aladdin have to be a computer? Alice was the boss of Aladdin. There's no place like cruel. I'm not a computer. I'm not a computer. I'm not a computer. I'm not a computer. Accept the cotton swap. You pay an extra for the cotton swap. How are you doing, buddy? I got the toes out and everything, right? There's something on the toes out on a Saturday night, right? And the hells? I think this is the first game many people here saw. Let's just get used to bozzity. And nails, I didn't see the net. Oh, you are fabulous out here to say look. I think this is the first game.
Hey, many people here saw! We got some positive incidents in here? Hey, thank you for socializing with other people for once. Don't stick together, huh? No, we don't think about y'all. They just know you're here. And then your Muslim and white are like, that's possible. How do you like that? It's like, it's like majority Muslim and other is normal. And then, it's like, it's like 51% Muslim and then 49% go to heaven and at night. It's a comic-man for president, like, I think it's a comic-man for the president of America. I think Shultz can pull it off. I think Shultz can be president someday. America! Land of the beautiful and Nancy Pelosi. I have an announcement. I am running for president. I am tackling all the issues. Climate change needs a new mascot. No one wants to hear an autistic, a high school grad he happened about recycling. She can pick up litter, but not a social cue. Come on, when I'm president, I will replace Greta Thunberg with the girls from euphoria so the sea levels won't be the only thing rising six inches. What should you bring? Don't send machine guns, send machine gun, Kelly. Ukraine needs a man that spends some time in a foxhole. The economy! Americans have lost 10% of their wealth to inflation. My solution? Higher, cheaper labor? Nope, not illegal immigrants. Women. I'm a progress! Abortion? Mandatory. And can only be done by a licensed NRA member. They know how to get one out of the chamber. Wow. I don't know if I'll say this, but I can't jump on one. Up against Donald Trump is a strange situation because you don't know who the crazy person is.
Kim Jong-un actually released a statement. The lead off North Korea, you release a statement saying Donald Trump is a psychopath.
I cannot work with him. Did I say that for him to send a message about Donald Trump? Well he's just like, guys I'm wild but I mean I can't, I don't know. This guy. And Donald is crazy. People ask Donald Trump to go like Trump or come on, you're not being serious. I mean tell Africans they go like that, come on man, Donald can't be that crazy man, hey? Come on you've got to give him a bit of credit man. Something, guys, that is crazy.
and they be like, easy luck, easy luck, easy luck, easy luck, easy, that's stupid in real life. And you're like, yeah, there's like, easy luck, easy stupid like, more lemur in them. And I'm like, no guys guys, do you guys have smart, don't play those games. I know people get tricked by do you guys, my lemur, Jake. Those guys are smarts, especially Jake and Zuma, people get fooled by him. You know, cause he got that cute vibe. Oh, he's giggling, hee, hee, hee, hee. That guy is a master tactician. Look now, votes are no confidence. He survived again. People are shocked. How did he do it? How did he do it? If he was days of our lives, he's the definite demeror of this game. Every day he wakes up looking in the mirror going, like cells through the hourglass. So are the days of our lives. Hee, hee, hee, hee, hee, hee. And a lot of people make that mistake. I've realized I think you make that mistake. I think our politicians are stupid. Maybe it's cause of how they speak. Maybe it's because of how they sound. Jacob Zuma's smart. Jacob Zuma was the head of intelligence for the ANC during the struggle. Jacob Zuma started the chess team on Roman Island. A lot of people don't know that. He started the chess team. Yeah, that's why he's so good removing the cabinet around. He's busy, yeah, prevent like that because he's a horse. Jacob.
He's been in the prevent like that because he's a horse. Check out. Donald Trump is not like that. One thing I'll say about Jacob's, who I catch him in a corner, ask him anything about policy, that guy will rattle it off. He may not know how to read, but he knows what he's talking about. Donald Trump has no clue about any policy that was ever. But your politics, he knows nothing about his health care. Every time Donald Trump answers the question, you know he doesn't know the answer, because he answers it like he's a contestant in one of his own beauty pensions. That's how he answers it. Every time you see Donald Trump on TV, you can see he's making up as he's going along. Every like Mr. President, can you tell us about your health care rollout and how preexisting conditions are going to be covered? I know! We're going to have so much coverage, folks, the best coverage. All the coverage, I'm going to get all of it. It's going to be so good, great. Some people even say the best. How's it going to work? It's going to work, it's just going to work, folks. It's going to work, it's going to be done. I'm going to do it! It's going to be done! And the people in South Africa and Iraq and the countries and health and insurance, and we're going to do all the things healthy with the money and also. Thank you. Mm-hmm. Donald Trump is losing his mind. It's taking craziest things. We're going to build a wall! And Mexico's going to pay for it! I love how Mexico's like, we in big for shit, man. We might build your wall, but we ain't paying for it, man. Stupid. Donald Trump's just doing his own thing. Everything seems to be going wrong for him. Now he's getting ready to start a wall, launch a nuclear weapon. North Korea! They all know fire and fury. Fury and fire! Fast and furious! Tokyo Drift! Like no one's ever seen. I think a good time. But he knows his policy. You can't say they're the same. Hell. And say what you want about J.G.D.D. but he knows how to handle his ladies. Yeah? He doesn't have any problems there. Donald Trump. Walking around in public, his wife's making his hand away. In public! Do you know how embarrassing that was? Donald Trump was there trying to hold Melania's hand. He slapped it away, trying to grab it. And in the second time, we're trying to grab it. Just like a little thing. And everyone was like, are they okay? Are they fighting? I was like, yeah, of course they're fighting. They're all hell of a time. Completely, hell of a time. You're trying to get me to see the video of the hands to know that they're having a bad time. I've had a theory for a long time that Donald Trump and his wife are not in a happy relationship. And I don't want to stop any rumors, but I have noticed this. I've noticed it in their speeches. Every time Donald Trump or Melania speak, it seems like they're throwing shade at each other.
They're giving a speech, but they're actually talking trash about the spouse. Every time all years, there's this. This is the subtext I want this day. For instance, Melania Trump, she made a speech about her platform in person, in America, every first lady, she used to choose what their dream job is going to be, what they're going to be doing to help the country. Michelle Obama says she's going to help kids get healthy meals and workouts. Melania Trump came out of one of she's shoes. She came out, no one knows what's going to be like.
As first lady, I believe we need to fight against the cyber-goole. All of the people on the Twitter who are saying the bad things we need to stop them. We need to make sure that they cannot carry on what they're doing. I think they know you're not doing anything. And then I realize you're doing all this. You're having fun, it's something. Keep on going, don't go that nice. Don't let your shoes all take on you. Don't drop me. We'll see you later. Turn on the lights. I'm a one, yeah. I saw what you said about me. On the news, it was very, that nice. Oh, hello, Donald. I didn't see you sitting over there.
I thought you were watching the cartoons. You know I was watching the news, Melania. I watched all the news. I think this. So what are you going to do about it, Donald?
I'm not going to be a fool, I'm not going to be a fool. I'm going to be a fool. You're going to war. You've got to war. I'm going to get you, Malaria. You're going to be. Do your worst, Donald. Oh, it's on. I'm the best at worst. The next day he came out gave a speech when he said, we've got to get rid of all these immigrants' drugs. All these immigrants need to live this country. You're a little Malaria. She went to a woman's conference. We need to stop sexual assault. The men who are grabbing the ladies without the permission. We need to stop. You got me to stop the shit out at home, man. I'm the worst encounter I had with the TSA. It was out in Burbank, California. I was trying to tell the airport, and I was flying out, and I was coming to New York, right? And so, I'm in Burbank airport, and I go through security. And for some reason, I was beeping. I don't know why. Go up in the middle of the sector. Go up, beep. Go up, beep. Go up. Every time I take something off, go up, beep. And the agent, he's just losing it. He's just losing it. He's the whole time. Take that off. Take it off. I'm going to beep, beep, beep. Take that off. Take that off. It's getting the boy and boy. I'm basically naked right now. And he's losing it. I felt like an underperforming strip. It was horrible. No, just, oh! Find these, like, you know what? Just get out of here. Get out of here. So I lost my side. Go ahead and tear. Go ahead and tear. And he whipped out a little mental, personal mental detective. Looks like it looks like a midget sort. But they call it the wand. That's what they call it the wand. So he whips that out, yeah. He's got a hundred thousand dollars in this play play.
She just got real. So he looks at me and says, go ahead and stick your hands off. So I just keep them right there. He stands and he's like... You got any... You got any, uh, little objects on you. And they will... Pull them on his left? No, no, no, no, no, no. If you were going to ask me anyway... No, no, no, no, no, no. The more is this, the foreplates are my honesty. What is this? Why? And then, as if he can't do this right, he calls for backup. He goes, how many are you waiting right? Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait. Can we get Velasquez's skater? Skater, I believe Velasquez's skater. And he calls for a man. And then Velasquez. One assuming was the best wonder that they had. Because he wasn't even on the floor. They called for him and Velasquez emerged. From the back offices of the TSA.
He walked out and the energy changed. People bowed their heads as he walked past. And one gave him a little nod. You could see he was special. And he didn't look like it. He didn't look like much. But that's because he was a little Mexican man. Very long, Mr. Ash, big chest. And he was very short, really, really short guy. But you know, he didn't feel short. You look short, but he didn't feel short. Do you know what I mean? Like he had this thing, you don't look short, people that are so confident. It looks like they just chose to grow, you know. He had that village. So if the mask is washed down, it's what I'm standing with my agents. My guy tries to apologize. He says, I don't know what's going on. I get sentenced to one of those things. I said, no. I got it. He stepped up. He looked me in the eye and was like, sir, you got to stand for a side? I'm not kept for that, OK? No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no. I didn't know what he was saying. I knew what he meant. That's why I stood there. I raised my arms. And as I did, he whipped out his arms. Ever come, I was just in my own, just blessing with his power. It was something special. It was like a force and energy. So, like on the outside, you still heard that people were like, me being like, eee, eee, eee, eee, eee, but in my head, I heard a lightsaber. That's what I heard. I was like, so, oh, oh, oh. Because he was, he was to me, a little Mexican Jedi. And this is exactly what he was. He's my Mexican Jedi. Which, by the way, I feel would be a welcome addition to the Star Wars franchise. I'm a big fan of my huge family's songs. I love stalks. I'm super excited when I found out they'd be making another one. I was losing my mind. I went back to watch all the movies, and I came to realize that there's no Mexican Jedi. There's no Mexican Jedi. There's no Mexican Jedi. Which is weird. Because when you look at a technique and speaking, technique and speaking, Star Wars is a vision of America in a distant future. So, surely it would be safe to say.
Judging by the current trajectory of Mexican people in America, I'm sure we'll be saying today that by that time, in a galaxy far, far away, there would be at least one. Just one Mexican jenna. It's not even like a whole spoiler story. Who knows? It might open up. The whole new avenue? It's crazy. I'm not. I just want these two kids. This Asian gentleman. It's not. Yeah. That's not the cool credit you can buy anything. We don't care about money. We want credit. So our credit is the assumption that you can pay back the money. It's like, no, no, that don't come out here, OK? In our country, you have good credit. You can buy anything, OK? You got good friends. In our country, I'll cut it. I'll be like, I hate to be rude. When you say our country, do you mean our, because you live here now? Or our, because the Chinese own it. And he was like, ah, it's a big old ball, OK? Yeah. I'm not credit for you, no, OK? Go back. Perhaps it's one of my self-worths, the problem thing to drive around. You won't start out. And don't trust movies. It's not easy to do. Alpha tie-backs in a whole of COVID zone.

Ah alright.
I'll bend here.
Mmm.
then get connect with you guys all the way back to the little baby I come on the list but it's I saw you alone. I would have asked you to dance. Oh, you wouldn't. Well, I don't know that. It was before my friend's time. What the hell are you having? Very funny. You wouldn't have asked me either. I would have asked you... in my head... on the way home. Well, I was having a good time. I'm sorry. Sheldon, can I come in? I don't think that's a good idea.
According to an online message board, I may be having a panic attack. Soccer Momo 9 had similar symptoms. To be fair, the twins were real handful that day. They're making me worry. What's going on? What's going on is we're about to go to a prom. There's a great deal of pressure on young couples like us to engage in what Mr. Boncubin is called making whoopie. What pressure always sit with you looking at some of these open-adorneds? It's not just that. Leonard and Penny also make comments about it. And I'm not lying, even I look twice when I saw my posterior in these tuxedo pants. So I met Jeannie at your end, Clannissons. They pass me the man in shapids. I took one look at this plurum and almost plots down the cookbook. This is for the solegula to talk about Indian. So my mother's okay with this? Why would your mother have a problem with me and Stuart? Because they have a weird, inappropriate relationship. Weirder than what you and I did in my dad's corolla? This is messed up. I know, I'm happy but that's time. Why would you even come to this? Didn't you know I'd be here? It was a long time ago, Howard. And your only second cousin's appears. So you knew when you were a great lady?
Oh, so she's good enough for Howard, but not for me? Yeah, well, your relationships with your own mother and cousin isn't this turf. Yeah! Well, I might not have asked her to answer that, but...
I'm gonna bless you now. There's no music. I don't care. We'll make our own music. God, I used to door-cams. Oh. Thank you. Thank you for wearing the socks. Thank you for wearing your heels. Thank you. Oh, no. That's okay. That's something pretty screw up the felt. Want to take a picture of us and send it to your old friends at the chess club? I sent them up between me trying to get years ago. This is nice. I don't wish no one else was coming. No, it's you. But we'll be fun to have a call without all the trauma. Oh! There! And that was tough again! I'm telling you, I'm helping you play up my family three. Sheldon, this is silly.
I'm missing another problem. Going upstairs now, goodbye. I really did think you looked pretty.
Yes. It's so much so good. I'm really sorry to be honest. Well, you can relax. Just because you think I look pretty, doesn't mean we have to spend the night together. Well, you're hoping we would because it's wrong. I'm always hoping. But tonight, I just wanted to have a nice time with you. Maybe dance with someone who has arms. Thank you for understanding. Of course I understand. Sheldon. There's something else I wanted to say, but before I do, I just want you to know that you don't have to say it back. I know you're not ready. I don't want you to say it just because social convention dictate what I'm here to. Oh, my God! There's no denying I have feelings for you that can't be explained in the other way.
I'd briefly consider that I had a brain parasite. But that seems even more for a fashion. The only conclusion was love. I know what's happening. This is a panic attack. Soccer avo9 says to lie down with your feet elevated. Okay. I'm gonna follow you. Just because I love you doesn't mean girls are allowed in my room. Okay. Kill me gold. Hey, Jeez.
Say cheese!
Yaayyyy teach me text...... 6... Say no!
Hang on. Hey, Debbie. I can't get a few of Jean. Okay, but we're just friends. It's... I gotta go. This is an easy one. You? Who loved this guy? Me. Come on. I'm not appreciating Jean. She's coming to me. It's not you. Nothing. There's a quarry in the bathroom.

How do I know if the English word open is an adjective noun or a verb?
What is an adjective?
40s and now.
What is a noun?
in your first answer.
The keyword up open.
open.
is associated with the store.
The story is unknown.
because it's a location.
Noun
because it's a location.
But...
When you explained
The keyboard opened as a verb.
The word door is also a noun.
because it's the name of an object.
So how can we distinguish?
The keyword open from noun to verb.
Do all sentences have subject verb object?
You
What if there is a sentence?
push that.
Let's say open book.
So how do we know whether this refers to the state of the book?
or acts as an instruction for someone else to open this book.
Whoop.
What part of grammar does the keyword open belong to?
What is an Engrammer?
On.
Is it a preposition?
What is an indefinite article?
Do you mean an example where the keyword open is used in a sentence?
Do me an example.

Let's give it a try.
Okay.
No.
I'm gonna ask Church utility a lot many questions, right?

To do that, I'm going to be redirecting just going to type.

Now let's say if I want to access
My file manager, which is here.
which is here.
I'm going to say that the conventional way of doing things is let's say like this we click on it.
and we can navigate to our desired folder.
let's say I want to access downloads.
I have some business in down.
So instead of doing this two-step process, what I can do is simply open downloads with a voice command.

So what's happening here is that I'm visiting a bookmark.
bookmark the URL.
which is I have a
I have created a title for this URL as data.
So whenever I say the title of this bookmark, it will straight away.
Open the browser and visit the URL.
Another thing that I can do is I can create as many bookmarks as I want. Let's say here we have open WhatsApp.
So if I say something like open WhatsApp, then it should open up.
Open a tab and visit
visit this particular URL.
So let's give it a try.
Open WhatsApp.
Now I have another bookmark which is called Open Netflix.
So let's see.
Open Netflix.
Now...
Let's say I want to go back to chat GPT.
and all I have to say again is
the title of the
bookmark chat jippity URL.
So let's give it a try.

Now in Chajibti we are going to ask a lot many questions.
and
Basically, we are going to type.
our questions here.
and uh...
whatever we want to say.
we can type it here the conventional way or
we can actually use our speech to text technology and redirect.
whatever we say.
into this input box.
So this is how it works as soon as a user selects this input box. Whatever they say will be...
build in this in the box and that's how they don't have to.
dive their questions anymore.
So let's give it a try how it works.
I'm just gonna go ahead and select this box first.
Give me a bash script that can print star pattern.
other thing.
Another thing that it can do is it can...
Oh.
Help me access the projects that I'm working on.
Dubduc pinned.
So that there are several projects, some of them are like...
Boarding related and some are not coding related.
So when I say the name of the project, who I opened this project, so it's gonna check whether this is a
coding related project or regular project.
and it's gonna figure out what is the best application to use to open that project.
So let me show you two different kinds of project first.
Jenny.
So Jenny is alias name for file manager.
whenever I say Jenny, it will open up file manager for me.
And here I have bookmarked my project. So this is the project that I'm working on. Turn it on Sam-a-acular.
several directories and
One of the projects is...
subject.
in my main course of study.
which has like a lot many PDF files, one is PPTX PowerPoint presentation.
that are two.
and there are no programming files here.
So whenever I want to access this project, I simply have to say the name of this project.
And of course I have to say open and then the name of this project.
Then it will open this project for me.
Then there is another project which is a programming related project.
Oh.
So this is the text classifier project and it has many programming files.
But the best way to open this project is not in a file manager but rather in a suitable app.
which is an IDE. This is what programmers use to
to write code and
Work with programming projects.
So I'm just going to close this thing.
And okay, so now nothing is open other than a browser and ICT
and the main engine that is currently running.
So all I'm gonna do now is try to access both those projects and see
if it can figure out
of the best applications.
by reading the contents of the project.
Open text classifier.
So now it has opened the text classifier project, but it has chosen to open this project in this particular app.
because it detected that, hey, there are programming files in this project, so I should use this particular app.
But the other project which is renewable energies and it's not a programming project. So it should open it in a file manager. I mean that's how I would like it.
So let's give it a try and see if it...
can detect.
it as a non-programment.
project and open it in file explorer
Open Renewable energy analogies.
Open Renewable Energy.
Jenny?
open renewable energy.
so it detected.
it worked correctly that
based on the contents, it's choosing the application to open that particular project.
Now let's say I'm going through this period about
These are like...
one of the
of the learning material for.
renewable energy and I have questions regarding
say hydropower is not completely.
climate neutral.
Let's say I want to Google.
Something
it to this because I don't fully understand this.
Google why hydropower is not completely climate neutral.
Google it for me.
but let's say I'm not happy with the...
with the response. I mean, I had a...
Bye.
went through several websites and I don't find the information I am looking for.
Run this query in match LGBT.
Data.
Oh, it gave us the
earlier code that we asked for. Let's run this score first.
Jason?
So like.
Jenny is an alias name for file manager Jason is an
alias name for this particular app.
So whenever I say JSON, it takes me here and
actually run this code.
the one I copied from GentryPT.
Create a bash script.
Let's call it star.
because it prints star pattern.
I'm gonna paste my code here.
Now I want to run this code and the way to do so is.
little bit complicated.
So it has printed as given as the star pattern. As Chagippity said, it will do the job.
Data.
as charge GPT suggested, hey, this is the pattern it will print.
what we are getting at you.
but this is a landier approach to type the exit commands.
Rather what we can do is we can actually create a voice command to do this.
for us.
So what I'm going to do is.
what I'm going to do is just simply run this file.
And I'm just going to say execute this file and it should.
Executives file for me.
Execute this file.

ah
some of the things to name a few, some of the things it can do is...
It can Google things for you if you want to run a Google query.
or if you want to access chat GPT, it can help you or it can assist you with
conversing with chat GPT.
then it can also help you with the access.
for the projects that you are working on.
So let's
a few things and.
see how it goes.
First of all, I guess the brightness is too low on my monitor. So I'm just gonna...
Light it up.
Increase brightness.
So now I'm gonna
I'm gonna just take a quick look at all the projects I'm working on currently
Show my projects.
So here is a
directory which hosts all my projects.
and some of them are...
Boding related, some of them are not.
and
Then let's consider this two projects. One is this renewable energy.
And.
And the other one is a text classifier.
So in the first project renewable energy
It contains all the learning material which are downloaded from
University website.
and it has various kind of PDF files. There are no coding related files here.
And in my another project, there is this text classifier. There are several types of
programming files, coding related files.
and the way to
Access this project is different.
because of their contents.
In programming, we have to like
edit the code and
run the code and do several things.
but they are not anything related for a file manager.
So.
The best way to open this project is actually open in a suitable app.
So...
This is the...
This is the...
perfect application for
kind of project where it

and

a straightforward access to the projects that you are working on.
So let's do a demo of a few things that it can do.
Oh
Let's see how it handles the projects.
that a person is working on.
So currently I have several projects and some of them are programming related.

For instance, I work on like several projects.
which are either programming related or just

First of all, I think the brightness is too low, so I'm just gonna light my monitors, light them up.

Hello, this is a demonstration video of a voice stand that can help its users to

So far it can do several things. It helps me with managing my projects or accessing them.
It helps me with Googling stuff if I want to run a Google query.
I can.
Do it with voice commands.
If I want to let's say

It can also help me.
in doing that.
And uh...
It can also do...
It can also execute.
I saw 10.
board that I have which is
Um, like my personal code and I want to create a binding between what I say and what that control

Rightness is.
is little bit dim.
and it's not optimum, like the view is not optimum for
in compared to compared in comparison to the
Ambient Lighting.
So I'm just going to light up my monitors.
increase brightness.
So what it is doing is I have
hooked up a code that can alter the brightness level of my monitors and
Whenever I...
Say the command.
increase or decrease the brightness it will execute that code.
So this is one thing let's check out how it can help me with Googling stuff.
Google, who is the Chancellor of Germany?
Bye.
Okay, so...
Anything I want to say, I can simply say Google and follow.
after that I can just say whatever is the query that I want to run.
it will google it for me.
Another thing it can do is it can help me with accessing.
Chagivity as well as conversing with Chagivity.
So yeah, it is a...
quick demonstration of how it works.
Data
So right now we are at chat GPT and
To access Chajapiti, I simply said data.
And the way this is working is that
I have created a bookmark.
or chatgipity URL.
and I have given it
a name as data. Data is from a
Bye!
a sci-fi movie character, I think Star Trek.
So data was one of the characters in that TV series. I guess it's not a movie series.
I have given
title or name property to this URL as data.
So what is happening here is that all my bookmarks have two main properties. One is the title and
Another one is the URL.
So if I say...
the title as a voice command.
It will learn.
visit this URL in my browser.
It doesn't matter whether the browser is alive or not or what application I am using.
I can.
open any book mug I want.
no matter what I, whatever other app I'm using or
browser is alive or not
Let's give it a try.

with no instance of browser application.
Data.
So besides data, there are other bookmarks as well. One is
Open Netflix, one is open Gmail.
Let's try this too as well.
Open Gmail.
Open WhatsApp.
Open Netflix.
I have everything here.
holders tail Bye bye. Byey lipidase.]
Nice.
One more thing it can do is let's say if we are currently on a tab, let's say on Netflix and I'm not even let's say using this app. I'm using some another app.
I'm gonna file manager somewhere.
And now I want to access chat GPT. So,
conventional ways to click on the browser and go to this tab right
So this is like a two step process and to bind this into one command.
that two things can happen at once.
that will give me really fast access to changeability.
or any other bookmarks for that matter.
Data.
So it switch to...
browser and then it also switch the tab.
From Netflix to Akira faces. Shavit video! Shavit TV Directs!
Okay, so let's see how it can handle
the projects that I'm working on.
Show my projects.
So I have several projects here in this directory. I hope.
created a MyProjects directory so that all the projects that I'm working on are in.
are in one place.
So let's take two different kinds of projects here to see how it handles.
different types of
projects based on their contents.
One is let's say let's consider renewable energy project.
Now this directory has various PDF files.
And there are no programming files here.
and the best way to access this.
The directory is...
to open it in a...
in a file manager so that I have
I have a view of all the PDFs.
and I can just...
Simply click on it and
have this access this PDFs, this learning materials. So this learning materials I got it from my
The university is
learning platform.
publish all the
All the...
learning material for a particular subject.
there. So I downloaded it and
it here. So whenever I want to access this
project I can simply say open the name of the project and it will open it.
For every project file manager is not a...
ideal choice because when it comes to programming, I want to
Um,
Open this enough.
particular app.
So this is the particular app open in code. It's Visual Studio Code.
And here I can do programming related stuff. And I want to
Open this particular project text classifier.
in this particular app called VS Code.
Visual Studio Code.
So
Normally what I do is.
I visit this project in my file manager and say open in code.
I'm sorry not say open in code but rather
Click on Open Encored.
it will open this directory in.
So again, it's like multiple step process. I have to find my project, then I have to open it, then right click, then I say open in code.
and it's a landier approach.
but a shortcut will be that we have some kind of way.
to access this.
projects with voice.
So let's say I want to open renewable energy.
and
Based on its contents, I want to open it in a file manager.
So this voice assistant can handle
kind of adversity in projects.
So let's try how it works and let's see if it can detect.
variation in project types.
Open Renewable Energy.
So it has figured out that.
Okay, the contents of the
Directory are not programming related. Let me use a file manager
Now I'm gonna open
Another project which was programming related and
Let's see how it can detect the contents of the project and choose an appropriate app to open that project.
Open text classifier.
So this is how I will want to open this project and it has
a pretty good job at it.
Okay, so now I can do...
what I do always with whatever I want to do with associated project.
Another thing.
which I forgot to mention earlier was with
gigantic
It can also allow you to
It can also help you to converse with chat GPT.
So.
The regular thing that person does with chargeability is to converse with chargeability.
where they type in their

And this query, this question and answering can be a very lengthy process and
Typing is not an ideal solution.
all the time because it can get very lengthy and we may have too many conversations and we may doectapo an
several number of times in a day. So the best thing to do is to redirect.
voice as a stench.
speech to text
n its its
into the chargeupiti. So we do not have to type anything to chargeupiti. We can simply say what we want.
and it gets typed.
Okay, so let's check it out.
Data
Now we are at Chagypity, now I'm going to just run my query.
Give me a bash script that can print star pattern.
After it taps in the input box, I can just
click on click
Press enter and...
It will run Macquarie.
Anything I can say will go into this input box. All I have to do is select this input box and start talking and it's going to
redirect everything I say here.
As you can see.
So let's say I'm done working for the

I wanna do this with voice.

I think it can do is it can help me with accessing.

One more thing it can do is let's say if we are currently on a tab, let's say on Netflix and I'm not even let's say using this app I'm using some other

So it switched to...
and then it was a switch.
from that place too.
So let's see how it can handle.

Okay, so I have some.

created a MyProject directory so that all the projects that I'm working on will be.
I'm in one place.
Soon.
take two different kinds of projects here.
to see how it handles sound.
different types of.
is based on their contents.
One is let's say let's consider renewable energy project.

I have a view of all the videos.
And, uh, again just, uh
simply click on it and out of this.
this video is learning my videos. So this learning my videos I got it from my...
University is

and the publishing, all the learning material for a particular subject there. So I downloaded it and

I'd like to introduce to you
Normally what I do is...
I visit this project in my mind.
and save open import.
I'm sorry not to see you open in.
Click on opening mode.
So it will open this directory in the...
Is that...
So again it's a multiple step process I have to...
And my project.
then right click and as you open it for.
and it's a linear approach but a shot
that we have some kind of faith.
to access this project with voice.
So let's say I want to open renewable energy and
Based on its contents, I want to open it in file manager not in VS code.
So, so, so, this...
What's the stick and hand is it?
kind of diversity in projects.
So let's try how it works and let's see if it can detect.

Okay. Hold on to hear where I was at?
So we just figured out that okay the contents of the

You can actually redirect your speech to text, whatever you say, to change if it is input box.
So let me show you.
Can you see my skin right?
Hey you there!
Okay, so if I want to say anything it goes here and I can run my query here
and
Yeah, the other thing is, let's say, so every person is working on several projects right from time to time.
So, and this project has different kinds of contents in them. For me, one project type is let's say.
It's a subject that I'm doing right now. It's called Renewable Energy and it has
Non programming files in that project.
Only PDFs.
It's like learning material.
And then the other projects that I work on is programming related. So there is a folder and there are a bunch of programming files. Okay.
So, the way I access this project is like different project requires a different application. So what it will do, so in the another monitor I am actually running this engine that I wrote.
What this engine is doing is it's a
Everything I say.
It figures out what context I'm saying stuff and it is aware of all my bookmarks, it is aware of my projects. So everything is at my disposal but only one command away.
all I have to do is invoke that command and it gets done.
Let's say I want to see all my projects that I'm working on.
for my projects.
Show my projects.
Alright.
So this is a directory in my desktop called my projects.
Now this structure has to be followed so that the engine can figure out where are your projects located and every project that you put in here will be read by the engine.
and create a command for you. You do not have to manually create it.
So this is the renewable energy folder.
and it has all the PDFs.
and there is one programming related folder which has programming related files.
So what I will do is I will open each project.
And the engine will figure out based on its contents what
What is the best choice of application for that project?
Mm hmm. Okay.
Open Renewable Energy.
So all my PDFs are here and it figured out that hey, renewable energy should be opened in file manager because there are a lot of many PDFs.
right but the text classifier thing
What I do is I visit this folder and I do this thing.
Open in code.
Now this is the application that I use as a developer to open this kind of folder.
But it's a lengthy process, so I'm going to simply dispatch a voice command.
Open text classifier.
So this is the same folder that you saw earlier but it's
Okay, so it can.
Yeah, so it can currently.
figure out two use cases. I mean, I'm coding it based on my needs because I cannot map everyone's needs.
Right now I will need more feedback and actually this thing is really more interesting. I am using this thing.
to develop this thing.
like in a low.
Okay, so every event, this thing.
This thing has a source code like it has a port that it is running. So if I say open your source code, it opens itself.
Ah, okay, nice, okay.
Really good.
Open your source code.
So this is the source code that is running behind.
Okay, now I get all what it can do. I'm gonna get a bit of the idea of what it can do. Now what do you want to do with this?
So this is like a warm, I mean.
bigger of a project for Mathesis and I am thinking to ask Professor that I will not submit the whole version but a bare minimum version just to show a few of the tricks. But how do I protect this like I feel like this is a kind of an IP because if I give it out openly, then I don't have anything to sell.
to anyone. It's my cell I mean.
like a let's say a prospective investor.
or let's say something like that.
ultanate suggest
Okay, let me see.
Doesn't your university have a program where you can eat your mouse's thesis and work on your Santa Maria?
Actually, no, there is no specific such program.
Please send me your example quick. Noel will do this sorted out.
Can you can you move it and see if it'll be you and?
Google EMC from TUM
Okay, I'm trying to tell you.
Yeah, okay, this is all I can do.
Uh huh. There's someone in the area. Get the money out there.
Let me check what is EMC.
So what happens is you can work on your startup idea and it stays with you for the whole time.
Hi!
So if you are getting, you cannot pay somewhat your subsidy, but also at the same time you are legally entitled to the thing that you come up with.
Okay, so like it's like a making it official
copywriting kind of a thing.
Yeah, yeah, so this is going to be and this is a program from the UMX.
There is also something called a CBT M.
CBT-N.
C failed T MDM site provider for digital transformation and monkey
Yeah, there is a condition in my thesis that whatever thesis I submit, I have to
deal with the rights that
Anyone else can freely use.
whatever I submit, there is a clause.
I mean this is the by de facto condition with master thesis.
whatever you do.
It has to be publicly available.
I don't know how to do it like this.
Because I don't have another project to submit as a master thesis.
But what I proposed, what I'm thinking of asking to the professor is that we have to
Oh.
We have to postpone the...
open sourcing. Yeah, so this is the thing I also wanted to tell you.
I'm actually planning to...
package this software into
and ready to download version.
And this thing will be free of charge. You do not have to buy subscription. It's free to use. It's like the social media apps that we use, what's up and all.
and no login required you do not need to login you do not need to buy a subscription
and you do not need a very expensive mid-range hardware, but not a very expensive hardware. And the reason for making it free and not subscription based is that
It will allow.
It will allow us to have maximum user onboarding.
it's free.
And.
One upside is that it does not require a server to run on cloud. We do not need to have a server except.
website.
But every application like WhatsApp and all they need back and so on.
My illness is really bad.
But yeah, so the thing is, if we make it open source right now.
What can happen if someone else can use that code package it.
and make a presence in the market and we will lose the edge.
But instead of doing that, we do what someone else might do.
that we package it not open source.
Okay, so okay, I can let go.
Does your Jesus really mean you to develop?
No, actually this is outgrown from a thesis, like where outgrown.
I think these are like
at least two different projects.
integration of two different projects. When you do something like impact of blah blah blah blah, for example if I see a marketing potential in this, so what I'm going to do is, as it ceases, impact of...
A I base sorry Charkand i base what you got there
on different fields. I can't just do a survey, I'm never thinking about it.
I'm not going to be solution with you.
the justice is
Given my type of film I am in.
I have to push some technical work.
and it cannot be just analytical work or...
Bye.
like survey kind of work.
That has to be some back.
So what I can do.
Your opinion is on scratch
Yeah, that's what I was going to say.
�HO always
The most basic is
I forgot the title.
Create a voice assistant that can execute personalized.
President x.
Thank you very much.
23
Yeah, yeah, so let's say it has like four it has applications in multiple domains. It does handle your bookmarks. It does handle your projects
And it can also control an application like let's say right now there are too many.
right?
in my browser.
But these are manageable taps but occasionally what happens is that they get cluttered out.
So I can close all the inactive tabs with a voice command. So I can control my browser with a command.
So I can, yeah, segment it. I can just segment it in your idea. I'm sorry to this one once I'm saying.
I think something which is almost already up there.
Ah ha ha, okay.
Okay, gotcha. Okay, for example, I'm not even searching for this, but for example, if there is a chat board saying which does, you know, this is closing tape. Okay, closing on that. Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay.
Maybe you just go a little bit and say that my mind is not closed on.
I'm nothart Trump in my
It's actually all causes of all the windows and not just to have something like that.
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah. I gotcha. Thank you. Thank you. That just led me also.
I don't want to let the seed run and find out what Jesus is.
Mm-hmm.
Yeah, so I will ask him for...
make a
Oh, he's a good guy
Yeah, I mean, you have a check-in for this also.
Should I ask him for an end lead?
You can, you can, I don't think it's alone.
You can, you have to open the discuss that with him, and I need to share this proposal with you.
Get out of an India on this.
So, I don't know.
Be scared of!
Can you wait one second?
Yeah, otherwise I don't see it on the...
So you have a system which I've made and then you cannot be the one to be able to...
Thank you, my question. OK, will you marry?
First of all, I don't know the process and secondly, I think I can get
patterned for some aspect of it.
but not
entire thing because I'm also using other open source technologies to make this work.
So I can get a patent for my thing.
but not everything.
The whole thing.
But the thing is you know if I patent it today
The thing is,
This thing is evolving.
beyond my, you know. So I patterned today in something like one month later, changes and then patterned is like no, not useful.
Okay, so I would actually suggest I'm skinless guy out of time.
Okay, that's number one. Okay, so wait.
mhm. Oh yeah. Yeah. Mhm. Yeah.
Okay, I would suggest to him. so
I will ask you in a separate measure.
I'm so scared. This would be a tough day. This would be a tough day.

Then what is the point of CTT? I'm like, why does it exist? What's different about it? Is it because? As long as you know it's difficultf percent inAnthony.
I'm not going to say anything like that in a month. I'm not going to say anything like that. Oh no. It's everywhere. I'm going to say anything like that.
It's kind of a pet. It's similar to patenting it.
Bye.
and you want the use to have to do the lead process.
I didn't protect you, I knew I was in the process.
Uh huh.
And if you have the course or any Padagata, how long is the course?
I've seen this two years but I think it's even two years ago and I forget to end up with the upside up.
Stay there and leave me alone.

There is communication about your lifestyle. And that includes thuring of heart graft from Tampa. You should've known both those people in Baltimore.

I need to do something sustainable in it, so mine that.
And that's where the bunker is with clean things.
But what do you? elderly
Hold the shutdown and send me ajaim.
I borrowing water and water I Turkish ah my laws nuance.
Okay, no problem. No problem. I just wanted to see your face. That's in the moment. Okay, so you were saying something about ventilabs.
Okay.
But I cannot do it alone. I need somebody in your field of work. Amen
can be possessed by an
Okay, it's on TUM website or is it a separate thing?
Let's move it into the...
Okay, but like in Germany, is it there? I mean, I need more context venture labs where like, is there, is it location based? Okay, yeah.
Okay, so this is the one option. The other option that we can have is Exist Startup Grant.
exist startup grant
I can share with you the PDF and the thing about it is that it gives you funding for a year as I said you told you earlier.
and uh...
better and better.
I'm sure that's what I want to do. I'm sure that's what I want to do.
No, actually no. The thing is, we do not have to patent it. We just have to be forced in the market.
Yeah, that's good, that's good, that's good.
Yeah, because whatever you want to publish, you want to become a...
Maybe be better, if you are going to be familiar with your comfort phrase
Yeah, six months is a long time and we can I mean it is far it is like really good in a good state and let's say if we go for exist and we have a funding so in few months within few months we can actually push off our version and I will explicitly ask professor that let's not release it open source or even if we are releasing it let's do it in a not in a bells and whistles way let's do it very quietly because we do not want much attention right now before we release it
Now we can get the rest of the ball. Yeah, I can.
Yeah, exactly. So, yeah. These are some problems. Can you show me all this? No.
return belly muscles asking if you can see it so why not use your second aid to aware you can see it so you can feed them down below and then we can go up for a rest of parallel."
you are better, I don't know or I don't know all of the way you're incorporates You know, it gives you some of the...
I don't know how to move it. As in like a... The owner of the first person ever went on the phone. I think we'll get closer.
Oh, really? Okay, yeah, I'm doing my master thing on the right knee. I'm not really having
every bad time, and my man EE
Okay So okay, so I will I will I will actually set up a meeting and see I mean I will present him everything and he also knows that open sourcing is not really it is always a Consider sympathetically and it's like depressing the open source journey
And right now, you know, somebody else can also make a WhatsApp or a Facebook, but they cannot beat them because of the... They were the first guys.
Like this signal also came you know.
the signals messaging him but it is open source but you know the vatsapp is already there. So I'm going to actually present it and I'm pretty sure that he will understand because he more much now. Yeah.
And also, if you want, okay some major friendlittle, and like shown this one. Inhale. Inhale. This one. Alright, that's pretty heavy here so make my family sleep. You got to have a great hangout here to help us because we've ended up having a lot of problems
I don't know about this one for a long, getting the waxed it's months. We are going to buy a farm in Germany. We can do it.
So which option do you suggest like a ventilabs or exist?
What should I tell him? Because yeah.
airs pirises of unfinished mortgage realized I'd like And then I go back in your iPhone. As you can see here, I'm ready for Herbert. Company flying on Sunday and I am wrestling. Khaazok tapping into where we are.ishersong.com And this resonant tanness sinking tight. So far, they know we moved, I think we made this earlier but we weren't going to a duplicate. We made it one day.
So let's say if we present our United Front for Exist startup. So in both the cases it will look good because you are from TUM and TUM has a good reputation. And a person from TUM is always like, hey, it's from TUM.
not diagoned off but TUM makes us stand. Okay, so let's say wherever we go, your TUM thing will help us a lot.
So we can go for ventilators as well as exist and you carry out your activities the best way you find. And I've got to tell you, and I've watched how you put the contact arm in the cigarette of therapy.
Like what you bring is like you are not a developer which is what I want the most I do not want someone a guy like me I do not want a guy like me balloon heat
because it's a different thing. So that's gonna be like a good look good because we have a diversified profile.
Yeah.
Yeah. And the another thing is I also need a engineer developer. So I'm thinking of a guy.
but not in a profound position, but as an engineer only. And he will be like doing most of the engineering work while I will be doing engineering plus research work. So that is one thing that I haven't told you.
And it can get.
How much luxury of time do you have right now?
Is it, do we have something?
Really?
The Gun od fuck behind you?
Okay, so let's continue this conversation later tonight as well because there is
I may massive features can be going on.
It smells so heavy.
Tomorrow, what time can you give me? Evening. Evening. Evening.
So I will meet professor day after tomorrow.
Yeah, yeah.
I mean what I'm going to tell him that is sorted.
I'm trying to ask you to be aware of the noise.
So no, professor thing is sold out, but I also want to tell you, let's say if you are doing this, I want to bring you on the page I am on.
Yeah, right. Right. Okay.
Okay, okay. And yeah, okay. So let's continue this conversation at length back tomorrow.
And I will, so I will, so I will, so I will go tomorrow or day after tomorrow.
