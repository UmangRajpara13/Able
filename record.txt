We should be together too Damn it sir, I'm too good to call and write my fans This will be the last pack, it's our ever-senior ass Been six months, it's still no word, I don't deserve it I know you got my last two letters, I wrote these dresses on a market So this is my cassette, I'm singin' you, I'm hilarious I'm in a car right now, I'm doin' 90 on a freeway Hey slim, I feel fit to put you in the drive You know this song, my bill call is the airman tonight You're about that guy who's gonna say that All the guys who drowned in was the end, then they'll saw it all Then had it so he found him, that's kinda how this is You could arrest you, me from drowning, now it's too late I'm on a thousand, now I'm drowsy, and all I wanted was a lousy letter of a call I hope you know I ripped all your pictures off the wall I love you slim, we gonna bring together, think about it You're ruined now, I hope you can't sleep and you dream about it And when you dream, I hope you can't sleep and you scream about it I hope you're conscious, eat into it, and you can't breathe without me See slim, in front of the song Hey slim, that's my girlfriend But I didn't, I just, I just, see I ain't like you Cause if you suffer more, need some soup Well, gotta go, I'm almost at the bridge now I forgot, I must go to see this, go!

You try to understand that I'd want you as a fan I just don't want you to do some crazy I've seen the one that's on the news a couple weeks ago That made me sick, no one's drunk and so is calling for a friend And then the party found a date, but they didn't say it was two Come to think about it, this name was... it was you Damn

But he keeps on forgetting what he wrote down, the whole crowd goes so loud, he opens his mouth, but the words won't come out, he's choking out. Everybody's choking now, the clock's run out, times up, over a cloud, smit back to reality. Up, there goes gravity, up, there goes gravity, choke, he's so mad, but he won't give up that easy note. He won't have any notes, his own backs and his ruffs, he's so mad.

There are the first few words, the new, better batch, the longest text in the entire history known in the universe. This has to have over 35,000 words. The current world market is so fucking annoying that I am going to imagine you are going to a friend's also you text is same normal, right? But it's what is easy to add up to the video.

We can kind of subtract, but I needed that. We needed that. Yeah. What did you apply for? Uh, what all of us should do that, um, we actually saw this. Which, what we needed to say about this, is that we have a new house. We will, uh, do you want more energy and become this house? Right. We need to get to the house. Of course. We need to be perfect about it, but we need to see what we got. We need to start with a single second. We need to be able to say, you know, I don't know, you know, that you're a good one. You know, you know, that you can't, that you can't, that you can't, that you can't, that you can't use. You can't use this. The house is specified a room to kind of see, when you say the room, the house is kind of, like, trying to be initiated. And then you can't wait. So you've got the house to be nice. And so, one is to just put on a little bit of your house. Okay, to get, I'll try to say, you can't say, you must be able to have a glass of glass to go right around. And so much value is that you have to be able to know this. If you make a look for the house that you are, the house isn't over planetized, but if you guys, I hope that you live to be behind, that you can't even live through the house. So you can live through nothing viewed. Because what you want to see is that you're feeling yourself from living. It's not as far as your life course is to live?! I don't know, where whatever appears, don't maybe you live within life that anyone's life. You know, I'm still there, too. I'm just listening to the old. I'm just going to go through it. I mean, you need to show that for people. Kind of, yes. Perhaps you want to hear a kick of sound. I mean, the phone is in the door. I mean, the phone is in the door.

Punjabi, are you sick? Sick, not so sick. Fuck the sakes, man. Those who do some weird and terrible shit, and they got that bracelet, that little sword bracelet. That's a bad ass bracelet. Not for real. It's back in the day that used to be a she. It would protect them from swords, because the six were the warrior class of people in India. And then over the years, you know, the meaning has changed now, is used to rest in a stairwell or whatever. And then over the years, you know, the meaning has changed now, is used to rest in a stairwell or whatever. But they got that bracelet walking that stairwell. They had never crashed, they were never crashed. You got this new take the wheel, huh? Did I get that right at least? I got that. You got that one perfect. Were your parents okay with you dating a black guy?

Brown parents don't give a fuck about the daughter, bro. I'm gonna go. I'm gonna go. I'm gonna go. I'm gonna go. I'm gonna go. I'm gonna go. Must be a doctor. I'm gonna go. You got that one, perfect.

Can I have a start with the region? I understand. I'm gonna go with the region. Okay. I'm gonna say... At least... Okay. Are you in the Middle East now? I'm in the Middle East now as well. Okay, a little too confident. I'm in the middle. Alright. Once that Ian Mubarak comes around, who knows what's going on. He's not really excited about that shit.

Our biggest export is from us Even though you're wrong that was a good fucking gas dude you to be aware of like Middle Eastern finances Sure gonna watch out well ballast that is the buffer Let's see what's going on over there Doc t.s. Is First of all, that's what I'm talking about. Because you've got no place in it, it's like home. I'm gonna talk about that. Wouldn't you really like handles this? You do? What's one to do? I'll see where you're safe.
Every animal, they're sweet. Every single animal, they all have life. You're right. I'm gonna say wait about that.
I feel like you haven't experienced enough life or death situations with animals.
and they can handle cares about your life.
I think a polar bear is going, you know what? She's probably got back in on Tuesday. Maybe I won't eat her. I'm just going to sit here with this Coca-Cola and sip it with my nephews. What I understand, you like animals because, you know, you live in the first world and it's boring. I don't care about you. I get it. I'll just take a look at this. Second. I'll paint almost thought you said, do you see me? I'm an animal. Then ask me. I was about to be like, oh, look at that. Second. I was about to be like, whoa. Because you're Asian, right? So that would make you panda a little bit, right? No. You're third world. You're third world. You're third world. You're third world. I'm third world. I'm third world. I'm third world. I'm third world. I'm third world. You're third world, but you're from America, right? You're born to race here. You're born to be born to Philippines. When did you come here? Oh, so you had some real shit. And in the Philippines, are there any animals that they eat that we don't eat here? You're not going to win this. You're not going to win this. It's not about what I lose. It's not about what I lose. I understand they said, in the Philippines, they eat dogs, because they don't care as much about dogs, right? Because they don't have to go like that. No, that's a call that they got to Wawa. Because they get too hungry. I don't know. Come, come, come, come, come, come, come. Right in there, right in there, right in there. There we go. I said war. I said war. With rice, almost a price off. That's all I'm saying. We're very lucky that we get to care about these. What part of Philippines we're from? Simple. Now is that a wealthy region or is that a poor region?
It's probably poor, right? I'm just guessing. It's... right? We don't got to go into it. It's a poor region where there's probably things there, right? That they'd be so lucky and grateful to have. That we just take for granted, right? You know what I'm saying? I'm drinking water right there. It might not be the best. Maybe there's some people that don't even have fresh drinking. You know? And tonight, you're going to go home and take a shit into clean water. That's why I hate this song. I care about my people back up. I just... We have to look at how people prefer when we're all coming. Watch.
Hey! Because I live in a Manhattan apartment that's heated by a radiator. So every morning I wake up like this. There's a building on fire!
Guys get out of right here There. Okay.
I'm taking this to the blanket and that's what the fuck it is. This is what we're doing. The place formed by a war was sounding like someone's beating it with a hockey stick. We'll go ask those questions. I guess that won't be good. We're going to go to the bathroom. This is our business. You can't let this hole in the hole directly to the smoke above my face. It's not a problem. We're the only city in the whole world where they don't tell us if you see something, say something. In every other city that's calling knowledge, go and see something that's running over. Take one tell people in your video that's his business. Oh, my gosh! That's a business. That's a business. That's a business. I asked one super in my whole life. One super. I asked him. I said Jose. One of those who fucking said I don't even know if that was his name. I just called him that shit. I can't write out the gate call to Jose. It's going to be your name, Jose, because I don't know what to tell you. I said Jose, you question why is the radio to make that clanking sound? Jose said to me, always because of the water. I actually waited like he was going to finish that door. I thought he was going to offer more clarity. He just stared at me like I was the idiot. What do you mean about the water? Oh, my God. Oh, okay. Okay, okay, okay, pop it. It's water come to reply. It's heated reply, it's heated reply, it's heated reply, it's heated reply. That's why I'm making the clanking sound. Okay, it's not the key. It's heated, it is to the left. He's heated to the apartment to the right, it's heated and it's all there. It's all making a lot of cred. There are so many kids, there are so many people. Do you know science? No! No! Aladdin taps. Please, it's a passion. Passver doesn't have to be a computer. Pass goes out of the heat. When do Aladdin have to be a computer? Alice was the boss of Aladdin. There's no place like cruel. I'm not a computer. I'm not a computer. I'm not a computer. I'm not a computer. Accept the cotton swap. You pay an extra for the cotton swap. How are you doing, buddy? I got the toes out and everything, right? There's something on the toes out on a Saturday night, right? And the hells? I think this is the first game many people here saw. Let's just get used to bozzity. And nails, I didn't see the net. Oh, you are fabulous out here to say look. I think this is the first game.
Hey, many people here saw! We got some positive incidents in here? Hey, thank you for socializing with other people for once. Don't stick together, huh? No, we don't think about y'all. They just know you're here. And then your Muslim and white are like, that's possible. How do you like that? It's like, it's like majority Muslim and other is normal. And then, it's like, it's like 51% Muslim and then 49% go to heaven and at night. It's a comic-man for president, like, I think it's a comic-man for the president of America. I think Shultz can pull it off. I think Shultz can be president someday. America! Land of the beautiful and Nancy Pelosi. I have an announcement. I am running for president. I am tackling all the issues. Climate change needs a new mascot. No one wants to hear an autistic, a high school grad he happened about recycling. She can pick up litter, but not a social cue. Come on, when I'm president, I will replace Greta Thunberg with the girls from euphoria so the sea levels won't be the only thing rising six inches. What should you bring? Don't send machine guns, send machine gun, Kelly. Ukraine needs a man that spends some time in a foxhole. The economy! Americans have lost 10% of their wealth to inflation. My solution? Higher, cheaper labor? Nope, not illegal immigrants. Women. I'm a progress! Abortion? Mandatory. And can only be done by a licensed NRA member. They know how to get one out of the chamber. Wow. I don't know if I'll say this, but I can't jump on one. Up against Donald Trump is a strange situation because you don't know who the crazy person is.
Kim Jong-un actually released a statement. The lead off North Korea, you release a statement saying Donald Trump is a psychopath.
I cannot work with him. Did I say that for him to send a message about Donald Trump? Well he's just like, guys I'm wild but I mean I can't, I don't know. This guy. And Donald is crazy. People ask Donald Trump to go like Trump or come on, you're not being serious. I mean tell Africans they go like that, come on man, Donald can't be that crazy man, hey? Come on you've got to give him a bit of credit man. Something, guys, that is crazy.
and they be like, easy luck, easy luck, easy luck, easy luck, easy, that's stupid in real life. And you're like, yeah, there's like, easy luck, easy stupid like, more lemur in them. And I'm like, no guys guys, do you guys have smart, don't play those games. I know people get tricked by do you guys, my lemur, Jake. Those guys are smarts, especially Jake and Zuma, people get fooled by him. You know, cause he got that cute vibe. Oh, he's giggling, hee, hee, hee, hee. That guy is a master tactician. Look now, votes are no confidence. He survived again. People are shocked. How did he do it? How did he do it? If he was days of our lives, he's the definite demeror of this game. Every day he wakes up looking in the mirror going, like cells through the hourglass. So are the days of our lives. Hee, hee, hee, hee, hee, hee. And a lot of people make that mistake. I've realized I think you make that mistake. I think our politicians are stupid. Maybe it's cause of how they speak. Maybe it's because of how they sound. Jacob Zuma's smart. Jacob Zuma was the head of intelligence for the ANC during the struggle. Jacob Zuma started the chess team on Roman Island. A lot of people don't know that. He started the chess team. Yeah, that's why he's so good removing the cabinet around. He's busy, yeah, prevent like that because he's a horse. Jacob.
He's been in the prevent like that because he's a horse. Check out. Donald Trump is not like that. One thing I'll say about Jacob's, who I catch him in a corner, ask him anything about policy, that guy will rattle it off. He may not know how to read, but he knows what he's talking about. Donald Trump has no clue about any policy that was ever. But your politics, he knows nothing about his health care. Every time Donald Trump answers the question, you know he doesn't know the answer, because he answers it like he's a contestant in one of his own beauty pensions. That's how he answers it. Every time you see Donald Trump on TV, you can see he's making up as he's going along. Every like Mr. President, can you tell us about your health care rollout and how preexisting conditions are going to be covered? I know! We're going to have so much coverage, folks, the best coverage. All the coverage, I'm going to get all of it. It's going to be so good, great. Some people even say the best. How's it going to work? It's going to work, it's just going to work, folks. It's going to work, it's going to be done. I'm going to do it! It's going to be done! And the people in South Africa and Iraq and the countries and health and insurance, and we're going to do all the things healthy with the money and also. Thank you. Mm-hmm. Donald Trump is losing his mind. It's taking craziest things. We're going to build a wall! And Mexico's going to pay for it! I love how Mexico's like, we in big for shit, man. We might build your wall, but we ain't paying for it, man. Stupid. Donald Trump's just doing his own thing. Everything seems to be going wrong for him. Now he's getting ready to start a wall, launch a nuclear weapon. North Korea! They all know fire and fury. Fury and fire! Fast and furious! Tokyo Drift! Like no one's ever seen. I think a good time. But he knows his policy. You can't say they're the same. Hell. And say what you want about J.G.D.D. but he knows how to handle his ladies. Yeah? He doesn't have any problems there. Donald Trump. Walking around in public, his wife's making his hand away. In public! Do you know how embarrassing that was? Donald Trump was there trying to hold Melania's hand. He slapped it away, trying to grab it. And in the second time, we're trying to grab it. Just like a little thing. And everyone was like, are they okay? Are they fighting? I was like, yeah, of course they're fighting. They're all hell of a time. Completely, hell of a time. You're trying to get me to see the video of the hands to know that they're having a bad time. I've had a theory for a long time that Donald Trump and his wife are not in a happy relationship. And I don't want to stop any rumors, but I have noticed this. I've noticed it in their speeches. Every time Donald Trump or Melania speak, it seems like they're throwing shade at each other.
They're giving a speech, but they're actually talking trash about the spouse. Every time all years, there's this. This is the subtext I want this day. For instance, Melania Trump, she made a speech about her platform in person, in America, every first lady, she used to choose what their dream job is going to be, what they're going to be doing to help the country. Michelle Obama says she's going to help kids get healthy meals and workouts. Melania Trump came out of one of she's shoes. She came out, no one knows what's going to be like.
As first lady, I believe we need to fight against the cyber-goole. All of the people on the Twitter who are saying the bad things we need to stop them. We need to make sure that they cannot carry on what they're doing. I think they know you're not doing anything. And then I realize you're doing all this. You're having fun, it's something. Keep on going, don't go that nice. Don't let your shoes all take on you. Don't drop me. We'll see you later. Turn on the lights. I'm a one, yeah. I saw what you said about me. On the news, it was very, that nice. Oh, hello, Donald. I didn't see you sitting over there.
I thought you were watching the cartoons. You know I was watching the news, Melania. I watched all the news. I think this. So what are you going to do about it, Donald?
I'm not going to be a fool, I'm not going to be a fool. I'm going to be a fool. You're going to war. You've got to war. I'm going to get you, Malaria. You're going to be. Do your worst, Donald. Oh, it's on. I'm the best at worst. The next day he came out gave a speech when he said, we've got to get rid of all these immigrants' drugs. All these immigrants need to live this country. You're a little Malaria. She went to a woman's conference. We need to stop sexual assault. The men who are grabbing the ladies without the permission. We need to stop. You got me to stop the shit out at home, man. I'm the worst encounter I had with the TSA. It was out in Burbank, California. I was trying to tell the airport, and I was flying out, and I was coming to New York, right? And so, I'm in Burbank airport, and I go through security. And for some reason, I was beeping. I don't know why. Go up in the middle of the sector. Go up, beep. Go up, beep. Go up. Every time I take something off, go up, beep. And the agent, he's just losing it. He's just losing it. He's the whole time. Take that off. Take it off. I'm going to beep, beep, beep. Take that off. Take that off. It's getting the boy and boy. I'm basically naked right now. And he's losing it. I felt like an underperforming strip. It was horrible. No, just, oh! Find these, like, you know what? Just get out of here. Get out of here. So I lost my side. Go ahead and tear. Go ahead and tear. And he whipped out a little mental, personal mental detective. Looks like it looks like a midget sort. But they call it the wand. That's what they call it the wand. So he whips that out, yeah. He's got a hundred thousand dollars in this play play.
She just got real. So he looks at me and says, go ahead and stick your hands off. So I just keep them right there. He stands and he's like... You got any... You got any, uh, little objects on you. And they will... Pull them on his left? No, no, no, no, no, no. If you were going to ask me anyway... No, no, no, no, no, no. The more is this, the foreplates are my honesty. What is this? Why? And then, as if he can't do this right, he calls for backup. He goes, how many are you waiting right? Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait. Can we get Velasquez's skater? Skater, I believe Velasquez's skater. And he calls for a man. And then Velasquez. One assuming was the best wonder that they had. Because he wasn't even on the floor. They called for him and Velasquez emerged. From the back offices of the TSA.
He walked out and the energy changed. People bowed their heads as he walked past. And one gave him a little nod. You could see he was special. And he didn't look like it. He didn't look like much. But that's because he was a little Mexican man. Very long, Mr. Ash, big chest. And he was very short, really, really short guy. But you know, he didn't feel short. You look short, but he didn't feel short. Do you know what I mean? Like he had this thing, you don't look short, people that are so confident. It looks like they just chose to grow, you know. He had that village. So if the mask is washed down, it's what I'm standing with my agents. My guy tries to apologize. He says, I don't know what's going on. I get sentenced to one of those things. I said, no. I got it. He stepped up. He looked me in the eye and was like, sir, you got to stand for a side? I'm not kept for that, OK? No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no. I didn't know what he was saying. I knew what he meant. That's why I stood there. I raised my arms. And as I did, he whipped out his arms. Ever come, I was just in my own, just blessing with his power. It was something special. It was like a force and energy. So, like on the outside, you still heard that people were like, me being like, eee, eee, eee, eee, eee, but in my head, I heard a lightsaber. That's what I heard. I was like, so, oh, oh, oh. Because he was, he was to me, a little Mexican Jedi. And this is exactly what he was. He's my Mexican Jedi. Which, by the way, I feel would be a welcome addition to the Star Wars franchise. I'm a big fan of my huge family's songs. I love stalks. I'm super excited when I found out they'd be making another one. I was losing my mind. I went back to watch all the movies, and I came to realize that there's no Mexican Jedi. There's no Mexican Jedi. There's no Mexican Jedi. Which is weird. Because when you look at a technique and speaking, technique and speaking, Star Wars is a vision of America in a distant future. So, surely it would be safe to say.
Judging by the current trajectory of Mexican people in America, I'm sure we'll be saying today that by that time, in a galaxy far, far away, there would be at least one. Just one Mexican jenna. It's not even like a whole spoiler story. Who knows? It might open up. The whole new avenue? It's crazy. I'm not. I just want these two kids. This Asian gentleman. It's not. Yeah. That's not the cool credit you can buy anything. We don't care about money. We want credit. So our credit is the assumption that you can pay back the money. It's like, no, no, that don't come out here, OK? In our country, you have good credit. You can buy anything, OK? You got good friends. In our country, I'll cut it. I'll be like, I hate to be rude. When you say our country, do you mean our, because you live here now? Or our, because the Chinese own it. And he was like, ah, it's a big old ball, OK? Yeah. I'm not credit for you, no, OK? Go back. Perhaps it's one of my self-worths, the problem thing to drive around. You won't start out. And don't trust movies. It's not easy to do. Alpha tie-backs in a whole of COVID zone.

Ah alright.
I'll bend here.
Mmm.
then get connect with you guys all the way back to the little baby I come on the list but it's I saw you alone. I would have asked you to dance. Oh, you wouldn't. Well, I don't know that. It was before my friend's time. What the hell are you having? Very funny. You wouldn't have asked me either. I would have asked you... in my head... on the way home. Well, I was having a good time. I'm sorry. Sheldon, can I come in? I don't think that's a good idea.
According to an online message board, I may be having a panic attack. Soccer Momo 9 had similar symptoms. To be fair, the twins were real handful that day. They're making me worry. What's going on? What's going on is we're about to go to a prom. There's a great deal of pressure on young couples like us to engage in what Mr. Boncubin is called making whoopie. What pressure always sit with you looking at some of these open-adorneds? It's not just that. Leonard and Penny also make comments about it. And I'm not lying, even I look twice when I saw my posterior in these tuxedo pants. So I met Jeannie at your end, Clannissons. They pass me the man in shapids. I took one look at this plurum and almost plots down the cookbook. This is for the solegula to talk about Indian. So my mother's okay with this? Why would your mother have a problem with me and Stuart? Because they have a weird, inappropriate relationship. Weirder than what you and I did in my dad's corolla? This is messed up. I know, I'm happy but that's time. Why would you even come to this? Didn't you know I'd be here? It was a long time ago, Howard. And your only second cousin's appears. So you knew when you were a great lady?
Oh, so she's good enough for Howard, but not for me? Yeah, well, your relationships with your own mother and cousin isn't this turf. Yeah! Well, I might not have asked her to answer that, but...
I'm gonna bless you now. There's no music. I don't care. We'll make our own music. God, I used to door-cams. Oh. Thank you. Thank you for wearing the socks. Thank you for wearing your heels. Thank you. Oh, no. That's okay. That's something pretty screw up the felt. Want to take a picture of us and send it to your old friends at the chess club? I sent them up between me trying to get years ago. This is nice. I don't wish no one else was coming. No, it's you. But we'll be fun to have a call without all the trauma. Oh! There! And that was tough again! I'm telling you, I'm helping you play up my family three. Sheldon, this is silly.
I'm missing another problem. Going upstairs now, goodbye. I really did think you looked pretty.
Yes. It's so much so good. I'm really sorry to be honest. Well, you can relax. Just because you think I look pretty, doesn't mean we have to spend the night together. Well, you're hoping we would because it's wrong. I'm always hoping. But tonight, I just wanted to have a nice time with you. Maybe dance with someone who has arms. Thank you for understanding. Of course I understand. Sheldon. There's something else I wanted to say, but before I do, I just want you to know that you don't have to say it back. I know you're not ready. I don't want you to say it just because social convention dictate what I'm here to. Oh, my God! There's no denying I have feelings for you that can't be explained in the other way.
I'd briefly consider that I had a brain parasite. But that seems even more for a fashion. The only conclusion was love. I know what's happening. This is a panic attack. Soccer avo9 says to lie down with your feet elevated. Okay. I'm gonna follow you. Just because I love you doesn't mean girls are allowed in my room. Okay. Kill me gold. Hey, Jeez.
Say cheese!
Yaayyyy teach me text...... 6... Say no!
Hang on. Hey, Debbie. I can't get a few of Jean. Okay, but we're just friends. It's... I gotta go. This is an easy one. You? Who loved this guy? Me. Come on. I'm not appreciating Jean. She's coming to me. It's not you. Nothing. There's a quarry in the bathroom.
