# Voice Interface for Computers #
Add voice commands to any Desktop Apps with system-wide shared Speech to Text Engine.â€‹
</div >

## Software Environment ##

  python 3.9.9  
  Nodejs 18.9  
  OS: Linux (very likely it will work on OSX without any tweaks. On Windows bash scripts(in ./universal-commands/scripts and anywhere in src) will have to converted into batch scripts)  

## Hardware Config used during Development and Execution ##

System Ram : 8Gb (2x4Gb) [Recommended > 16Gb]  
Graphic card : Nvidia Graphics MX350(Pascal Architecture, CUDA capability 6.1, VRAM 2GB)  
Microphone : External Bluetooth Headeset with Microphone Arm (Recommended). Avoid using in-built microphone of your laptop.  

The project uses [Whisper](https://github.com/openai/whisper) by OpenAI which requires the command-line tool [`ffmpeg`](https://ffmpeg.org/) to be installed on your system, which is available from most package managers:


```bash
# on Ubuntu or Debian
sudo apt update && sudo apt install ffmpeg

# on Arch Linux
sudo pacman -S ffmpeg

# on MacOS using Homebrew (https://brew.sh/)
brew install ffmpeg

# on Windows using Chocolatey (https://chocolatey.org/)
choco install ffmpeg

# on Windows using Scoop (https://scoop.sh/)
scoop install ffmpeg
```

## Milestones ##

- Develop an C++ addon for Python part of this project.
Hence, it will eventually become an Electron App.

- Add support for realocation of speech-to-text service for other uses cases (as requested by other apps) besides microphone service.
